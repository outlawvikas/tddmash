# Word Clock TDD Demo

Mimics wall-art "word clocks" that show time in five-minute intervals as a selection of highlighted words, e.g.:

![english word clock][english]

Or in Spanish:

![spanish word clock][spanish]

## Discussion, history and slides

This demo was built to showcase TDD (Test Driven Development) in [my session][sesh] at CodeMash 2020. The commit history is arguably
more instructive than the final code, particularly in conjunction with the slides.

The slides can be found at [roub.net/pres/codemash2020][slides].

Video of the presentation is expected in a month or so; I'll add that here as well when available.

## Usage

Open `demo.html` in a reasonably-modern  browser  and the clock should run, updating at the various 5-minute marks. Click anywhere on the clock face to toggle between English and Spanish
